# Randomly Generated Maths Quiz
Python program that randomly generates simple maths questions

This has 2 modes:
- Timed
    - Allows you to set a countdown timer
- Infinite
    - Goes on forever until you get a question wrong

You can also choose the range of numbers to be used for the questions.

A tutorial is included in the program which goes more in-depth about the 2 modes.

# How to run
You obviously need Python installed first to be able to open Python files.

To run the program, you must have getkey installed:
```py
pip install getkey
```
Or:
```py
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Then you can run the program:
```py
python main.py
```

# Running on Linux
Edit the Python file and change every instance of "cls" to "clear".

"cls" is a Windows thing to clear the terminal, I don't know why it doesn't work with "clear".
